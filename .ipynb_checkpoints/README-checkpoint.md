This repo contains code for the following experimental equipment. More about the equipment can be found in my Ph.D. thesis : [Hydrophobic Fluoropolymer Nano-Coatings: Study of Anti-Reflective and Anti-Soiling Properties and Applications]('Hydrophobic Fluoropolymer Nano-Coatings.pdf').

* Pulsed Deposition Apparatus - Ref. Chapter 2.2.1
* Pulsed Deposition Apparatus v2 - Ref. Chapter 2.2.1
* Simulated Dew Condensation Chamber - Ref. Chapter 2.3
